 ## 🌟 Challenge 2

## Description: Verifiable Credential Website/App Creation 🌐

Welcome to the Verifiable Credential Challenge! In this exciting challenge, participants are invited to create a website or app that leverages Polygon ID to enforce specific access requirements. By utilizing verifiable credentials, you can build a gated digital experience where access is granted only to those who meet certain predefined criteria.

**🔍 Challenge Objective**: Design and develop a website or app that utilizes Verifiable Credentials to implement access restrictions. Examples could include *age verification*, *membership proof*, or any other creative use case where credentials are required to access certain features or content.
