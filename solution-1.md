# Solution 1: My solution to the first idTHon task.

After some serious research about PolygonId and other related terms/technologies, I was able to come up with a great Twitter thread.
Here is a link to the thread - https://twitter.com/AJ_Okpainmo/status/1675292298693713921

Beyond the Twitter thread, I was able to craft a very impressive and educative post for PolygonID on my blog. I linked to the blog post in the Twitter thread.
But here is the link to the blog post as well - https://zhacks.hashnode.dev/polygonid-and-the-decentralized-self-sovereign-identityssi-revolution

Thanks!
