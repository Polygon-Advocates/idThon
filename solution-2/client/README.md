# This is a Verifiable Credential (VC) Gated Website

- My hosted example website: https://birthday-gated-website.on.fleek.co/
- In order to see the gated part of the website, you need a [KYCAgeCredential Verifiable Credential](https://www.notion.so/oceans404/How-to-get-a-KYCAgeCredential-Verifiable-Credential-f3d34e7c98ec4147b6b2fae79066c4f6?pvs=4) with a birthday after January 1, 2023, held in the Polygon ID Mobile wallet app.

## About

This is an opinionated template for creating VC gated dapps with

- frontend library: [React](https://react.dev/)
- component library: [Chakra](https://chakra-ui.com/)
- wallet connection libraries: [Rainbowkit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/) using WalletConnect v2, wagmi, & viem hooks

## How to run locally

#### 0. Follow server setup instructions

Before starting the frontend, run the server by following [the server instructions](https://github.com/oceans404/fullstack-polygon-id-vc-gated-dapp/tree/main/server). You need the ngrok url from the server in order to start the frontend.

#### 1. Install frontend dependencies with --legacy-peer-deps

Make sure to run the install command with the --legacy-peer-deps flag.

```bash
npm i --legacy-peer-deps
```

Unfortunately some of the dependencies are mid migration and use different legacy versions of typescript, so you need to run the command and all other dependency installations with the flag or you'll see installation errors. When installing any other dependencies in this project, use the flag.

For example, here's how you could install react router:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom --legacy-peer-deps
```

#### 2. Create a .env file by copying my sample

```bash
cp .env.sample .env;
```

Update your .env with the REACT_APP_VERIFICATION_SERVER_PUBLIC_URL variable to your hosted server ngrok url. If you're hosting in production with render, use the render url for this variable.

Visit https://cloud.walletconnect.com/ and create a new project (free and takes 2m). Update REACT_APP_WALLET_CONNECT_ID with the resulting Project ID.

Quick check: Make sure you've updated these values in .env, not .env.sample ðŸ¤ 

#### 3. Start the frontend

```bash
npm start
```

Visit http://localhost:3000/

#### 4. Optional: host your website using Fleek

I've documented a similar hosting process here: https://github.com/oceans404/fullstack-sockets-demo#deploy-your-frontend

## Logic flow

This frontend interacts with the verifier server to

- Watch for events emitted by socket for the user's specific sessionId
  - frontend: https://github.com/oceans404/vc-gated-website/blob/main/src/PolygonIDVerifier.js#L48
  - backend:
    - getAuthQr in progress https://github.com/oceans404/vc-verifier/blob/main/index.js#L63
    - getAuthQr done: https://github.com/oceans404/vc-verifier/blob/main/index.js#L86
    - handleVerification in progress: https://github.com/oceans404/vc-verifier/blob/main/index.js#L100
    - handleVerification done: https://github.com/oceans404/vc-verifier/blob/main/index.js#L135
- Request the QR code containing the birthday query (zk request) for display
  - frontend fetch: https://github.com/oceans404/vc-gated-website/blob/main/src/PolygonIDVerifier.js#L62
  - backend getAuthQr: https://github.com/oceans404/vc-verifier/blob/main/index.js#L37
  - backend birthday query: https://github.com/oceans404/vc-verifier/blob/main/proofRequest.js
- Report verification result to the rest of the app: https://github.com/oceans404/vc-gated-website/blob/main/src/App.js#L39
