 ## üåü Challenge 2

## Description: Build a verifiable Credential Website/dApp üö™

Welcome to the Verifiable Credential Challenge! In this exciting challenge, participants are invited to create a website or app that leverages Polygon ID to enforce specific access requirements. By utilizing verifiable credentials, you can build a gated digital experience where access is granted only to those who meet certain predefined criteria.

**üîç Challenge Objective**: Design and develop a website or app that utilizes Verifiable Credentials to implement access restrictions. Examples could include *age verification*, *membership proof*, or any other creative use case where credentials are required to access certain features or content.

## üìù Steps to Participate: 

1Ô∏è‚É£ Visit the GitHub repository for detailed instructions and resources: [GitHub Repo Link](https://github.com/oceans404/fullstack-polygon-id-vc-gated-dapp) This is a template that you can use for your Verifiable Credential gated website or dApp. 

2Ô∏è‚É£ Familiarize yourself with Polygon ID and specially Verifier SDK and their role in digital identity verification. You may refer the docs [here](https://0xpolygonid.github.io/tutorials/) and a detailed video from Steph explaining the [**Verifier SDK**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZCFpnxOi-nWYUoGrGbSEcjIf1Vmb35NP/view?usp=sharing)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Brainstorm and choose an access control scenario for your website/app. Consider creative ideas that require the use of Verifiable Credentials.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Use the provided resources in the GitHub repo to understand the technical implementation.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Design and develop your website/app, integrating Polygon ID. 

6Ô∏è‚É£ Test your implementation thoroughly to verify the effectiveness of the Verifiable Credential gating mechanism.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Document your process, challenges faced, and solutions implemented.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Submit your completed project details [**here**](https://airtable.com/shrNCmi6zP4RDklNi)  

**NOTE:** Add the link to the GitHub repo in `solution-2.MD` file, and then while adding the details in the submission, follow the [guidelines](https://github.com/Polygon-Advocates/idThon/blob/main/pull_request_template.md) mentioned in the IDThon GitHub.
