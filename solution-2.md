## Challenges Faced

### Custom Issuer Node Setup
Setting up a custom issuer node for the web app presented several challenges:
- Ensuring compatibility of the custom issuer node with the chosen blockchain platform.
- Resolving configuration and dependency conflicts.
- Testing and validating the issuer node's functionality. 🧩🔍🚀

### Ngrok Port Forwarding for Issuer Node Access
Configuring ngrok for secure external access to the custom issuer node's API endpoints posed challenges:
- Setting up ngrok to tunnel traffic to the issuer node.
- Ensuring secure and reliable communication.
- Managing ngrok configurations for changing issuer node setups. 🔒🌐🛠️

### Custom Schema Type Specific to Our Web App
Designing a custom schema type specific to the web app's requirements involved challenges such as:
- Determining necessary data attributes and structure.
- Ensuring compatibility with the issuer node and blockchain platform.
- Validating and testing the custom schema. 💡💻🔍

### Verifier Multi-Requests Clubbing for Single Proof Generation
Aggregating multiple verification requests for efficient proof generation by the verifier presented challenges like:
- Designing a scalable system to handle multiple requests.
- Ensuring data privacy and security during the aggregation process.
- Optimizing proof generation for improved efficiency. 🔄🔐⚡

These challenges were overcome through research, consultation, and thorough testing and validation processes. 📚🤝✅
